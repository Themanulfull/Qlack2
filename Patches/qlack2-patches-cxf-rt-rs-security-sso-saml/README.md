# Patch for SAML Web SSO signature validation (DEPRECATED)

DEPRECATED: Apache CXF 3.1.14 has already incorporated the present patch. The patch module will be removed from Qlack sources by the end of February 2018.

This is to patch `cxf-rt-rs-security-sso-saml` to support signature
validation on SAML Responses.
See [relevant discussion](http://cxf.547215.n5.nabble.com/JAX-RS-SAML-Web-SSO-Validating-SAML-Response-in-OSGi-td5781687.html).

The change consists of patching `org.apache.cxf.rs.security.saml.sso.SAMLProtocolResponseValidator`
in CXF 3.1.8 similarly to this
[GitHub commit](https://github.com/apache/cxf/commit/0287f7d3a30908cdde0ca30f470f2103dab26a7c#diff-4869efd874233eb9778d8d26b4bdc49c).

In addition to this patch, we are also preparing a replacement Karaf
feature for `cxf-rs-security-sso-saml` (`qlack-patch-cxf-rs-security-sso-saml`)
which contains the patched JAR.

## When this patch should be removed

 is released.
* A new Karaf version containing the above release is also released.
